-- Show how the list comprehension [(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]] with two generators can be re-expressed using two comprehensions with single generators. Hint: nest one comprehension within the other and make use of the library function concat :: [[a]] -> [a].

meow = concat [[(x, y) | x <- [1, 2]] | y <- [3, 4]]
